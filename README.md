# Star Schema Implementation in a Redshift Cluster

## 1 - Summary
This is a simple project to demonstrate how to implement a star schema model into a Redshift cluster on AWS. It was developed as a condition for approval in a Data Engineer nanodegree at [Udacity]](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-engineer-nanodegree--nd027). 

### Contextualization
A hypotetical startup Sparkify required for a data engineer to develop and implement a data pipeline into their Redshift Cluster. 

## 2 - Hands-on


**Pre-requisites**
- AWS Reshift Cluster available and running

### 2.1 Creating the tables


### 2.2 Loading data into Redshift cluster tables

### 2.3 Checking if the data was correctly loaded
